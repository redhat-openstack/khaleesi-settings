# NOTE(psedlak): hotfix for tester/tempest enforcing provisioner/openstack
#
# the problem is that tester/tempest (due to structure redesing in dev/tkammer)
# as try to simplify the structure, contains parts for provisioning
# (adds tester node one asks for some tester)
# but it is provisioner-specific (atm openstack)
# and expects some extra variables, not used for bm provisioning etc
#
provisioner:
  flavor:
    small: 'not-used-for-baremetal'
  images:
    fedora:
      '22':
        id: 'not-used-for-baremetal'
        remote_user: 'not-used-for-baremetal'

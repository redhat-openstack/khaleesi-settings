Adding a New Hardware Environment
=================================

Each hardware environment must have:
 - instackenv.json file describing your baremetal nodes
 - vendor_specific_setup file containing commands required to set up the environment for deployment
 - hw_settings.yml file containing values that will be used in undercloud.conf and deploy-overcloudrc files

If there are no additional commands required to set up the environment, the vendor_specific_setup file is still required however it can be empty (as in the hp_dl320g8 environment).
